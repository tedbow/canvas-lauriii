# @drupal-canvas/cli

## 0.25.2

### Patch Changes

- 24ad226: `canvas pull` no longer overwrites an existing local `package.json`.
  It now preserves the local file and adds each dependency from the pulled
  `dependencies` that is absent from the local `dependencies`,
  `devDependencies`, and `peerDependencies` to the local `dependencies`, using
  the pulled version. Existing versions, scripts, and other fields are left
  unchanged. When no local `package.json` exists, the pulled one is written as
  before.

## 0.25.1

### Patch Changes

- 239a9a9: Explicitly set the React component type during non-headless push so
  existing external components become Canvas-managed React components.

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- 9eb64a3: Add brand kit color synchronization support.
  - Carry brand kit colors in `canvas.brand-kit.json` under a new `colors` key
    alongside `fonts`: a map from the CSS custom property name (without `--`) to
    a CSS color string (`#rrggbb`, `#rrggbbaa`, `rgb()`, `rgba()`, `hsl()`,
    `hsla()`) or a `{value, name, displayFormat}` wrapper. Display names derive
    from the key, so `"brand-red": "#cc0000"` is a complete entry.
  - Pull colors from the site into the file and push entries to the site's color
    endpoints, matching by the variable the key names. A pull right after a push
    produces no diff, and a push right after a pull writes nothing.
  - Never delete a site color that is absent from the file by default; report it
    and offer the explicit `canvas push --prune-colors` opt-in.
  - Validate the file at the start of push — before authentication or any
    request — naming the offending entry for malformed values, invalid keys, two
    keys naming the same variable, and duplicate display names (the site
    requires unique color names).
  - Validate `canvas.brand-kit.json` in `canvas validate`: JSON syntax,
    structure against a published JSON Schema, and the semantic rules a schema
    cannot express (key collisions, ranges inside color strings, font files
    existing on disk). Files the CLI creates carry a `$schema` reference so
    editors validate and autocomplete them.
  - Brand kit is now included by default: `canvas pull` and `canvas push` sync
    the brand kit without any flag. Pass `--no-include-brand-kit` to opt out, or
    set `CANVAS_INCLUDE_BRAND_KIT=false`.
  - `canvas:brand_kit` is now part of the default OAuth scope. Existing tokens
    will request this scope on their next refresh.
  - `--include-brand-kit` (positive form) is deprecated and emits a warning.
    Remove it from scripts; `--no-include-brand-kit` is the supported opt-out.

### Patch Changes

- f65ea20: Add the `v0.langcode` entry to `dataDependencies.drupalSettings` for
  components that import `canvasFormatDate`, `canvasFormatDateTime`,
  `canvasFormatTime`, or `canvasFormatDateRange` from `drupal-canvas`, so that
  published pages format dates in the active Drupal locale.
- Updated dependencies [f65ea20]
  - drupal-canvas@0.6.0

## 0.24.1

### Patch Changes

- 5b4d934: Move the page template support check before authentication and
  continue syncing other resources when page templates are not supported.
- 52cec0f: Fix page template pulls to use resolved prop values.
- d863921: Allow metadata preflight to validate components importing
  dependencies included in the same push, while retaining dependency validation
  during upload.
- Updated dependencies [3ed0539]
  - drupal-canvas@0.5.2

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- da4015e: Add page template synchronization support.
  - Replace global regions with page templates. Projects using the old global
    region files or configuration must migrate before running sync commands.
  - Pull, push, validate, and reconcile media for page templates stored by
    default in `page-templates/`.
  - Allow pages and content templates to select a page template with the
    `pageVariant` field.
  - Let one page template become the site default with `"default": true`.
  - Configure page templates with `pageTemplatesDir`, `sync.pageTemplates`, and
    `--no-page-templates`.

- 2d22d81: Reconcile external document media in push flows.
  - `reconcile-media` uploads external document URLs (`pdf`, `rtf`, Office,
    OpenDocument, and iWork formats) referenced by document props as `document`
    media entities. The document's `title` and `description` are sent along with
    the file.
  - The default OAuth scopes now include `canvas:media:document:create`.

- 78e3ff2: Validate authored Code Component metadata against the Canvas
  contract.
  - Validate raw `component.yml` envelopes and directly resolvable prop schemas
    locally.
  - Use the authenticated target site's non-mutating validation operation when
    available, and warn when target acceptance was not validated.
  - Preflight every complete Code Component payload before push mutations when
    the target supports it.
  - Derive content entity reference preview targets from
    `dataDependencies.entityFields`.

### Patch Changes

- 8ba09a5: Fix pushing link props whose value is a relative reference without a
  leading slash.
  - `uri-reference` and `iri-reference` values such as `page.html?x=1`, `?x=1`
    or `#section` are now sent as authored. Previously they were prefixed with
    `internal:`, which the server rejects because an `internal:` URI requires a
    leading slash.
  - Root-relative values such as `/about` are still sent as `internal:/about`,
    matching what the Canvas UI stores.
  - URI schemes are now detected case-insensitively, so `HTTPS://…` is no longer
    treated as a relative path.

### Minor Changes

- 761cfbb: Trust system CA certificates to support working with DDEV
  environments over HTTPS.
- 761cfbb: Set minimum Node.js requirement: >=22.19.0 <23 || >=24.5.0.

  - @drupal-canvas/eslint-config@0.8.0

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 9bcfe16: Push components as external metadata when the Canvas Headless SDK is
  present.
  - `push` detects `@drupal-canvas/headless` in the project and uploads every
    component as `type: external` — metadata only, no JS/CSS — since a decoupled
    app owns rendering.
  - A `type: external` in a component's `component.yml` is honored the same way
    without the SDK. The YAML file is never mutated; `type` is set on the API
    payload only.
  - Entry-less components (for example `.vue`, `.astro`, `.svelte` single-file
    components) are discovered instead of being dropped as missing a JS entry.
  - Existing external components are updated rather than recreated, and are
    never deleted by `push`. A local/remote component type mismatch is rejected
    at planning time with an actionable error instead of a confusing server
    rejection.

- 8933c5e: Add support for pushing and pulling local modules, assets, and
  `package.json`.
  - `push` uploads local module and asset dependencies used by components,
    carrying their disk path and, for text modules, their verbatim source.
  - `push` stores the project's `package.json` verbatim alongside the global
    CSS.
  - `pull` writes local module and asset dependencies, and `package.json`, back
    to the project. Existing files are overwritten by default, or skipped with
    `--skip-overwrite`.

### Patch Changes

- 7b03749: Fix component pulls to use JSX or TSX entry extensions that match the
  pulled source.

## 0.21.3

### Patch Changes

- 7bcf0cc: Fix reconcile-media to support bearer token authentication

  The reconcile-media command now uses ensureAuthConfig() instead of directly
  requiring clientId/clientSecret, allowing it to work with CANVAS_ACCESS_TOKEN
  bearer token authentication like other commands (push, pull, build).

## 0.21.2

### Patch Changes

- cbb1a53: Fix content template creation by omitting the unsupported `label`
  property from create requests.

## 0.21.1

### Patch Changes

- d71fdd4: Preserve resolved media and link props when pulling and pushing
  global regions.
