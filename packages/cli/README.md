# Drupal Canvas CLI

A command-line interface for managing Drupal Canvas code components, which are
built with standard React and JavaScript. While Drupal Canvas includes a
built-in browser-based code editor for working with these components, this CLI
tool makes it possible to create, build, and manage components outside of that
UI environment.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @drupal-canvas/cli
```

## Setup

1. Install the Drupal Canvas OAuth module (`canvas_oauth`), which is shipped as
   a submodule of Drupal Canvas.
2. Choose an authentication flow:
   - **Interactive login (recommended for individual developers):** Follow the
     [authorization code setup](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/canvas/-/tree/1.x/modules/canvas_oauth#23-interactive-login-with-canvas-login)
     and run `npx canvas login`. Tokens are stored in
     `~/.config/drupal-canvas/oauth.json` and used automatically — no
     environment variables needed.
   - **Client credentials (for CI/CD or service accounts):** Follow the
     [client credentials setup](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/canvas/-/tree/1.x/modules/canvas_oauth#22-configuration)
     and configure `CANVAS_CLIENT_ID` and `CANVAS_CLIENT_SECRET`.

### Configuration

The Canvas CLI uses three types of configuration:

- **canvas.config.json** - Repository-committed configuration for values tied to
  your codebase structure (where files are stored, build output locations)
- **canvas.brand-kit.json** - Optional Brand Kit configuration: fonts and
  colors. When Brand Kit sync is enabled, `canvas push` and `canvas pull` use it
  to sync both with the global Brand Kit. See
  [Colors (Brand Kit)](#colors-brand-kit) and
  [Font push (Brand Kit)](#font-push-brand-kit).
- **.env** - Environmental configuration and secrets that should not be tracked
  in version control (site URLs, OAuth credentials)

#### canvas.config.json (Optional)

This file is an optional configuration file that contains values tied to how
your codebase is structured and should be the same for all developers working on
the project. These values are committed to version control.

Create a `canvas.config.json` file in your project root with any of these
properties:

```json
{
  "componentDir": "src/components",
  "pagesDir": "pages",
  "contentTemplatesDir": "content-templates",
  "aliasBaseDir": "src",
  "outputDir": "dist",
  "globalCssPath": "src/global.css",
  "sync": {
    "pages": true,
    "contentTemplates": true,
    "pageTemplates": true
  }
}
```

**Properties:**

| Property                | Default               | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `componentDir`          | `"src/components"`    | Directory where Code Components are stored in the filesystem. It must be inside `aliasBaseDir` for local builds.            |
| `pagesDir`              | `"pages"`             | Directory where pages are stored in the filesystem.                                                                         |
| `contentTemplatesDir`   | `"content-templates"` | Directory where content templates are stored in the filesystem.                                                             |
| `aliasBaseDir`          | `"src"`               | Base directory for module resolution when using path aliases in your components. Tied to your project's import structure.   |
| `outputDir`             | `"dist"`              | Build output directory (similar to Vite's `build.outDir`). Defines where compiled assets are generated.                     |
| `globalCssPath`         | `"src/global.css"`    | Path to the global CSS file.                                                                                                |
| `sync.pages`            | `true`                | Include pages in `pull`, `push`, and `reconcile-media`. Set to `false` to exclude pages by default.                         |
| `sync.contentTemplates` | `true`                | Include content templates in `pull`, `push`, and `reconcile-media`. Set to `false` to exclude content templates by default. |
| `pageTemplatesDir`      | `"page-templates"`    | Directory where page templates (page variants) are stored in the filesystem.                                                |
| `sync.pageTemplates`    | `true`                | Include page templates in `pull`, `push`, and `reconcile-media`. Set to `false` to exclude page templates by default.       |

If `canvas.config.json` is not present, the CLI will use the default values
shown above. For existing projects, if `globalCssPath` is not set and
`src/global.css` is missing, the CLI temporarily falls back to
`src/components/global.css` when that file exists. Move the file to
`src/global.css`, or set `globalCssPath` explicitly to keep the legacy location.

#### canvas.brand-kit.json (Optional)

Brand Kit configuration — fonts and colors — lives in `canvas.brand-kit.json` in
the project root. When Brand Kit sync is enabled, `canvas push` and
`canvas pull` use it to sync both with the global Brand Kit. Example:

```json
{
  "fonts": {
    "defaults": {
      "weights": ["400"],
      "styles": ["normal"],
      "subsets": ["latin"]
    },
    "families": [
      {
        "name": "Inter",
        "provider": "google",
        "weights": ["400", "700"],
        "styles": ["normal", "italic"]
      },
      {
        "name": "My Font",
        "src": "fonts/MyFont-Regular.woff2",
        "weights": ["400"],
        "styles": ["normal"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "colors": {
    "brand-red": "#cc0000",
    "overlay": "hsla(220, 60%, 50%, 0.5)",
    "santa-face": {
      "value": "#0000FF",
      "name": "Father Christmas"
    }
  }
}
```

Files the CLI creates carry a `$schema` reference so editors validate and
autocomplete them, and `canvas validate` checks the whole file offline. See
[Colors (Brand Kit)](#colors-brand-kit) and
[Font push (Brand Kit)](#font-push-brand-kit).

#### Colors (Brand Kit)

The `colors` key is a map from color key to CSS color value: the key becomes the
CSS custom property name (`"brand-red"` becomes `--brand-red`). Values are CSS
color strings (`#rrggbb`, `#rrggbbaa`, `rgb()`, `rgba()`, `hsl()`, `hsla()`) or
a `{ "value": …, "name": …, "displayFormat": … }` wrapper when an entry needs
more than its value.

Example:

```json
{
  "colors": {
    "brand-red": "#cc0000",
    "overlay": "hsla(220, 60%, 50%, 0.5)",
    "santa-face": {
      "value": "#0000FF",
      "name": "Father Christmas"
    }
  }
}
```

The display name shown in the Canvas editor defaults to the key converted to
title case ("Brand Red"), unless the wrapper asserts one. The site requires
color names to be unique (compared case-insensitively).

`displayFormat` controls how the color appears in the Canvas editor's color
picker (`"rgb"`, `"hex"`, or `"hsl"`). It is derived automatically from the
value form you write — a hex string displays as hex, `rgb()` as RGB, `hsl()` as
HSL — so you only need to set it if you want the editor to show a different
format than the one you wrote.

`canvas pull` writes the site's colors into the map (keeping semantically equal
entries byte-for-byte) and `canvas push` creates and updates colors on the site,
matched by the variable the key names. A color that exists on the site but not
in the file is never deleted by default — push reports it and continues. Pass
`--prune-colors` to `canvas push` to delete such colors. A color that is in use
by a component instance or template cannot be deleted; push continues with all
other operations, reports the site's reason for each refusal, and fails at the
end only if any deletions were refused.

**Folders:** Color folders are managed in the Canvas UI only. Colors that
already exist on the site retain their folder membership when updated by push.
Colors created by push (i.e. keys present in the file but not yet on the site)
land in the colors root; use the Canvas UI to move them into folders afterward.
Color props can be configured in the UI to restrict their picker to colors from
specific folders. That restriction is not enforced by the CLI: a pulled file may
contain color values from outside the allowed folders, and those values can be
pushed without error. However, a newly pushed color will not appear as an
available option in the prop's color picker until it is placed in a supported
folder via the UI.

#### Font push (Brand Kit)

When `canvas.brand-kit.json` is present and Brand Kit sync is enabled, the
`push` command will resolve each family (via a provider or a local file), upload
the font files to the site, and sync the font list to the global Brand Kit. Push
replaces the remote font set with the set from config; an empty `families` list
clears all fonts on the global Brand Kit. Fonts are stored on the Brand Kit
entity and generate `@font-face` CSS for the Canvas editor and front end. This
uses [unifont](https://github.com/unjs/unifont) for provider-based families.

For user-facing Brand Kit docs, see
[Code Components - Brand Kit](../../docs/user/src/content/docs/code-components/brand-kit.mdx).

**canvas.brand-kit.json shape:** The file has a top-level **`fonts`** key (other
brand kit keys may be added later). Under `fonts`:

- **`defaults`** (optional): Default `weights`, `styles`, and `subsets` applied
  to provider-based families when not overridden per family.
- **`families`**: Array of font family entries. Each entry is either:
  - **Provider-based:** `name` (required), `provider` (optional: `google`,
    `bunny`, `fontshare`, `fontsource`, `npm`, `adobe`), and optionally
    `weights` (array of strings, e.g. `["400", "700"]` or `["100 900"]` for a
    variable font range) and `styles` (array of strings, e.g.
    `["normal", "italic"]`). Aligns with [Nuxt Fonts](https://fonts.nuxt.com)
    (same unifont backend). Also optionally `subsets` and `axisDefaults` (for
    variable fonts, see below). When a family does not set `subsets`, only the
    `latin` subset is used (to avoid large variant counts).
  - **Local file:** `name` (required), `src` (path relative to project root,
    e.g. `fonts/MyFont.woff2`), and optionally `weights`, `styles` (arrays of
    one value each for a single variant), and `axisDefaults`.
  - **`axisDefaults`** (optional): For variable fonts, overrides the default
    value for an axis (e.g. `"axisDefaults": { "wght": 500 }`). Values are
    clamped to the axis min/max; omitted axes keep the font file’s default.
- **`providers`** (optional): Provider-specific options (e.g.
  `adobe: { id: ["your-kit-id"] }` for Adobe Fonts).

`fontsource` is the Fontsource CDN API; `npm` resolves `@fontsource/*` and
`@fontsource-variable/*` from `node_modules`. Variable font axes are extracted
when possible (e.g. from the font file) and stored on the Brand Kit. The CLI
adds human-readable axis names (e.g. "Weight", "Optical size") for common
OpenType axis tags so the Brand Kit UI shows the same CSS axes sliders and
labels as for fonts uploaded via the UI.

If you still have `CANVAS_COMPONENT_DIR` set in your shell, `.env`, or
`.canvasrc`, the CLI will warn you and offer to create or update
`canvas.config.json` with `componentDir`.

#### .env

This file contains environmental configuration that varies between environments
(local development, staging, production) and secrets that must never be
committed to version control.

Configuration sources are applied in order of precedence from highest to lowest:

1. Command-line arguments
2. Environment variables
3. Project `.env` file
4. Global `.canvasrc` file in your home directory

You can copy the
[`.env.example` file](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/canvas/-/blob/1.x/cli/.env.example)
to get started.

| CLI argument             | Environment variable               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--site-url`             | `CANVAS_SITE_URL`                  | Base URL of your Drupal site. Can point to different environments (local dev, staging, production).                                                                                                   |
| `--client-id`            | `CANVAS_CLIENT_ID`                 | OAuth client ID. Different environments may have different OAuth clients with different permissions.                                                                                                  |
| `--client-secret`        | `CANVAS_CLIENT_SECRET`             | OAuth client secret. This is a secret credential that must never be committed to version control.                                                                                                     |
| `--scope`                | `CANVAS_SCOPE`                     | (Optional) Space-separated list of OAuth scopes to request. Tied to your specific Drupal site's OAuth configuration. Defaults to standard scopes.                                                     |
| _(none)_                 | `CANVAS_ACCESS_TOKEN`              | (Optional) Pre-issued Bearer token. When set, skips the OAuth client credentials flow entirely. `CANVAS_CLIENT_ID`, `CANVAS_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `CANVAS_SCOPE` are ignored. Must not be empty if set. |
| _(none)_                 | _(none)_                           | User tokens from `canvas auth login` are stored in `~/.config/drupal-canvas/oauth.json` (keyed by site URL) and used automatically. No environment variable is needed.                                |
| `--no-pages`             | `CANVAS_INCLUDE_PAGES`             | (Optional) Exclude pages from `pull`, `push`, and `reconcile-media`. `CANVAS_INCLUDE_PAGES` is deprecated; use `sync.pages` in `canvas.config.json` instead.                                          |
| `--no-content-templates` | `CANVAS_INCLUDE_CONTENT_TEMPLATES` | (Optional) Exclude content templates from `pull`, `push`, and `reconcile-media`. `CANVAS_INCLUDE_CONTENT_TEMPLATES` is deprecated; use `sync.contentTemplates` in `canvas.config.json` instead.       |
| `--include-brand-kit`    | `CANVAS_INCLUDE_BRAND_KIT`         | (Optional) Include brand kit (fonts and colors) in `pull` and `push`. Defaults to `true`. Use `--no-include-brand-kit` to disable. Accepts `true`/`false`, `1`/`0`, or `yes`/`no`.                    |
| `--no-page-templates`    | _(none)_                           | (Optional) Exclude page templates from `pull`, `push`, and `reconcile-media`. Use `sync.pageTemplates` in `canvas.config.json` for a project default.                                                 |

**Note:** When `CANVAS_SCOPE` is unset, the CLI uses the `canvas_oauth`
defaults. Brand kit sync is on by default; when it is enabled (or explicitly
enabled via `--include-brand-kit` or `CANVAS_INCLUDE_BRAND_KIT`), it adds the
`canvas:brand_kit` scope. When pages, content templates, or page templates are
enabled through `sync` config, defaults, or deprecated env vars, it adds the
corresponding `canvas:page:*`, `canvas:content_template`, and
`canvas:page_variant` scopes.

#### Configuration Precedence

The CLI uses different precedence rules depending on the type of configuration:

**For canvas.config.json path and build properties** (`componentDir`,
`pagesDir`, `contentTemplatesDir`, `aliasBaseDir`, `outputDir`,
`globalCssPath`):

Configuration sources are applied in order of precedence from highest to lowest:

1. **Command-line arguments** (e.g., `--dir`, `--alias-base-dir`,
   `--output-dir`) - Highest priority
2. **canvas.config.json** - Values defined in your project's config file
3. **Default values** - Built-in defaults if nothing else is specified

**For canvas.config.json sync properties** (`sync.pages`,
`sync.contentTemplates`, and `sync.pageTemplates`):

Configuration sources are applied in order of precedence from highest to lowest:

1. **Command-line arguments** (`--no-pages`, `--no-content-templates`, and
   `--no-page-templates`) - Highest priority
2. **canvas.config.json** - Values defined in your project's config file
3. **Sync environment variables** (the deprecated `CANVAS_INCLUDE_PAGES` and
   `CANVAS_INCLUDE_CONTENT_TEMPLATES`; page templates have none) - Used only
   when the matching `sync.*` key is omitted from `canvas.config.json`
4. **Default values** - Built-in defaults if nothing else is specified

Example: If you have `"componentDir": "components"` in `canvas.config.json` but
run `npx canvas build --dir ./my-components`, the CLI will use
`./my-components`.

**For .env properties** (`siteUrl`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `scope`):

Configuration sources are applied in order of precedence from highest to lowest:

1. **Command-line arguments** (e.g., `--site-url`, `--client-id`) - Highest
   priority
2. **Environment variables** (e.g., `CANVAS_SITE_URL`, `CANVAS_CLIENT_ID`) - Set
   in your shell or CI/CD environment
3. **Project `.env` file** - Values defined in your project's `.env` file
4. **Global `.canvasrc` file** - Values in your home directory's `.canvasrc`
5. **Default values** - Built-in defaults if nothing else is specified

Example: If you have `CANVAS_SITE_URL=https://dev.example.com` in your `.env`
file but run `npx canvas pull --site-url https://prod.example.com`, the CLI will
use `https://prod.example.com`.

## Supported Imports in Canvas Code Components

Canvas Code Components support the following import patterns. Unsupported
patterns are caught by the `drupal-canvas/component-imports` ESLint rule during
[`npx canvas validate`](#validate). See the
[imports and assets documentation](../../docs/user/src/content/docs/code-components/imports-and-assets.mdx)
for the full list of supported and unsupported patterns.

### Third-Party npm Packages

Any npm package installed in your project can be imported:

```js
import { motion } from 'motion/react';
import * as Accordion from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';
```

> **Important:** Third-party packages are bundled and uploaded as vendor
> artifacts. Use [`npx canvas push`](#push) to include them.

### Shared Local Modules via `@/` Alias

Utilities and helpers can be imported from shared locations **outside** of any
component directory using the `@/` alias:

```js
import { formatPrice } from '@/lib/helpers';
```

> **Important:** Shared local imports are bundled and uploaded as artifacts. Use
> [`npx canvas push`](#push) to include them.

> **Note:** Importing from _within_ another component's directory (e.g.
> `@/components/pricing/helpers`) is not supported. Move shared code to a
> non-component location such as `@/lib/`.

### Other Canvas Code Components

Other Canvas Code Components can be imported using the `@/` alias:

```js
import Button from '@/components/button';
```

---

## Upgrading from global regions

Page templates (page variants) replaced theme global regions (Canvas ADR 0019):
the `regions/` directory, the `regionsDir`, `sync.regions`, and `layoutPath`
config keys, the `--no-regions` flags, and the `CANVAS_INCLUDE_REGIONS`
environment variable are no longer supported, and region files are no longer
pushed, pulled, or validated. To upgrade an existing codebase:

1. Run `canvas pull`. Page templates are written into
   `page-templates/<id>.json`.
2. Delete the `regions/` directory, remove `regionsDir`, `sync.regions`, and
   `layoutPath` from `canvas.config.json`, and unset `CANVAS_INCLUDE_REGIONS`.

The CLI warns when it detects any of the leftover region state above. The site
itself must be on a Canvas release with page variants: its module update
converts the default theme's regions into one `theme_<theme>` page variant that
renders identical markup and becomes the site default. That is a Drupal-side
action; when the connected site does not serve page templates yet, sync commands
say so and suggest asking a site administrator. Note that a variant converted
from theme regions contains the theme page template component, which is not a
code component: such variants are reported and skipped by `canvas pull`, and
stay managed in the Canvas editor instead of the authored codebase.

---

## Commands

### `pull`

Pull code components, global CSS, package.json, local modules imported by
components, pages, content templates, page templates, and brand kit (fonts and
colors) from Drupal to your local filesystem. Brand kit sync is on by default
when `canvas.brand-kit.json` is present; use `--no-include-brand-kit` to skip
it.

If the project's `package.json` was stored on a previous `push`, it is
reconciled with the local file during pull. When no local `package.json` exists,
the stored one is written to the project root. When a local file exists, its
contents are preserved: each dependency from the stored `dependencies` that is
absent from the local `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, and `peerDependencies`
is added to the local `dependencies`, using the stored version. Existing
versions, scripts, and other fields are left unchanged. Use `--skip-overwrite`
to leave an existing `package.json` untouched, the same as global CSS.

**Usage:**

```bash
npx canvas pull [options]
```

**Options:**

- `-d, --dir <directory>`: Component directory (defaults to `componentDir` from
  `canvas.config.json` or `src/components`)
- `--no-pages`: Exclude pages from the pull operation
- `--no-content-templates`: Exclude content templates from the pull operation
- `--include-brand-kit [enabled]`: Include brand kit (fonts and colors) in the
  pull operation. Defaults to `true`; use `--no-include-brand-kit` to disable.
- `--no-page-templates`: Exclude page templates from the pull operation
- `-y, --yes`: Skip all confirmation prompts (non-interactive mode)
- `--skip-overwrite`: Skip items that already exist locally

**About prompts:**

- Without flags: Prompts for confirmation before pulling
- With `--yes`: Fully non-interactive (suitable for CI/CD)
- With `--skip-overwrite`: Skips items that already exist locally
- With both `--yes --skip-overwrite`: Fully non-interactive and only pulls new
  items

**Examples:**

Pull Code Components and global CSS:

```bash
npx canvas pull
```

Pull Code Components and global CSS without pages or content templates:

```bash
npx canvas pull --no-pages --no-content-templates
```

Skip brand kit sync:

```bash
npx canvas pull --no-include-brand-kit
```

Pull only new items (skip existing):

```bash
npx canvas pull --skip-overwrite
```

Fully non-interactive, only pull new items:

```bash
npx canvas pull --yes --skip-overwrite
```

Pulls Code Components, global CSS, pages, content templates, page templates, and
brand kit (fonts and colors) from your site by default. Use `--no-pages`,
`--no-content-templates`, `--no-page-templates`, or `--no-include-brand-kit` to
exclude those resources for a single run, or set `sync.*` in
`canvas.config.json` to change project defaults. Use `--skip-overwrite` to skip
items that already exist locally.

**Fonts:** The pull command fetches fonts from the global Brand Kit, downloads
font files into a `fonts/` directory, and adds local `src` entries to
`canvas.brand-kit.json`. Matching is done at the variant level (family +
weight + style). Variants already present in your config (e.g., from a previous
push) are skipped, so push-then-pull is idempotent. New variants added via the
Canvas UI for a family you already have in config are downloaded and appended to
`families`.

**Colors:** `canvas pull` writes the site's colors into the `colors` map in
`canvas.brand-kit.json`. Entries already in the file that match the server value
are kept byte-for-byte. Local-only entries (not on the site) are preserved at
the end of the map and reported. `--skip-overwrite` only appends new colors and
leaves existing entries untouched.

### `scaffold`

Create a new code component scaffold for Drupal Canvas.

```bash
npx canvas scaffold [options]
```

**Options:**

- `-n, --name <n>`: Machine name for the new component

Creates a new component directory with example files (`component.yml`,
`index.jsx`, `index.css`).

---

### `build`

Build local components, vendor dependencies, and Tailwind CSS assets using
automatic component discovery.

**Usage:**

```bash
npx canvas build [options]
```

**Options:**

- `-d, --dir <directory>`: Directory to scan for components (defaults to
  `componentDir` from `canvas.config.json` or `src/components`)
- `--alias-base-dir <directory>`: Base directory for module resolution (defaults
  to `"src"` from `canvas.config.json`)
- `--output-dir <directory>`: Build output directory (defaults to `"dist"` from
  `canvas.config.json`)
- `-y, --yes`: Skip confirmation prompts (non-interactive mode)

**Examples:**

Build all discovered components:

```bash
npx canvas build
```

Build components in a specific directory:

```bash
npx canvas build --dir ./my-components
```

Build with custom output directory:

```bash
npx canvas build --output-dir ./build
```

Build with custom alias base directory:

```bash
npx canvas build --alias-base-dir lib
```

Non-interactive mode for CI/CD:

```bash
npx canvas build --yes
```

This command automatically discovers all components in the specified directory
(or `componentDir` from `canvas.config.json`) and builds them with Vite-powered
optimized bundling. It requires the global CSS file configured by
`globalCssPath` (default: `src/global.css`).

1. **Component Discovery** - Automatically finds all valid components using the
   discovery package
2. **Component Build** For each component, a `dist` directory will be created
   containing the compiled output. Additionally, a top-level `dist` directory
   (or configured `outputDir`) will be created, which will be used for the
   generated Tailwind CSS assets.
3. **Import Analysis** - Analyzes and categorizes third-party packages and local
   alias imports
4. **Vendor Bundling** - Uses Vite to create optimized bundles for third-party
   dependencies in `dist/vendor/` with proper code splitting and minification
5. **Local Import Bundling** - Uses Vite to bundle local alias imports (e.g.,
   `@/utils`) into `dist/local/`
6. **Tailwind CSS** - Generates Tailwind CSS for all discovered local components
   using the local global CSS entry point
7. **Manifest Generation** - Creates `canvas-manifest.json` with import maps for
   all bundled dependencies

The build output is optimized for production use with Vite's code splitting,
tree-shaking, and dependency management.

### `push`

Non-headless push converts external components back to Canvas-managed React; a
later headless sync makes them external again.

Build and push local components, global CSS, build artifacts, pages, content
templates, page templates, and brand kit (fonts and colors) to Drupal. Brand kit
sync is on by default when `canvas.brand-kit.json` is present; use
`--no-include-brand-kit` to skip it.

**Usage:**

```bash
npx canvas push [options]
```

**Options:**

- `-d, --dir <directory>`: Directory to scan for components (defaults to
  `componentDir` from `canvas.config.json` or `src/components`)
- `--no-pages`: Exclude pages from the push operation
- `--no-content-templates`: Exclude content templates from the push operation
- `--include-brand-kit [enabled]`: Include brand kit (fonts and colors) in the
  push operation. Defaults to `true`.
- `--no-include-brand-kit`: Exclude brand kit from the push operation.
- `--no-page-templates`: Exclude page templates from the push operation
- `--prune-colors`: Delete colors from the site that are absent from
  `canvas.brand-kit.json`.
- `-y, --yes`: Skip confirmation prompts (non-interactive mode)

**Examples:**

Push all discovered components:

```bash
npx canvas push
```

Push components without pages or content templates:

```bash
npx canvas push --no-pages --no-content-templates
```

Skip brand kit sync:

```bash
npx canvas push --no-include-brand-kit
```

Push components in a specific directory:

```bash
npx canvas push --dir ./my-components
```

Non-interactive mode for CI/CD:

```bash
npx canvas push --yes
```

This command discovers components, analyzes and bundles dependencies, builds
Tailwind CSS, and uploads the selected content to your Drupal site. When no
local components are discovered, component build, global CSS upload, and
artifact sync are skipped so page-only or Brand Kit-only pushes do not overwrite
component assets. Push can include:

1. **Components** - Built and uploaded as js_component config entities
2. **Global CSS** - Tailwind CSS assets uploaded as asset_library. The project's
   `package.json`, when present, is stored verbatim on the same asset_library
   entity so a later `pull` can reconstruct it. It is opaque metadata and is
   never parsed.
3. **Fonts and Colors** - If `canvas.brand-kit.json` is present, fonts are
   resolved (via unifont or local `src`), uploaded, and synced to the global
   Brand Kit. Colors are created or updated on the site matched by CSS variable
   name. Colors on the site but not in the file are reported and left untouched
   unless `--prune-colors` is passed.
4. **Vendor artifacts** - Bundled third-party dependencies
5. **Local artifacts** - Bundled local imports (e.g., `@/utils`)
6. **Shared chunks** - Common code shared between vendor bundles
7. **Pages** - Canvas pages built from components, unless excluded with
   `--no-pages` or `sync.pages: false`.
8. **Content Templates** - Content templates that define component layouts for
   entity view modes, unless excluded with `--no-content-templates` or
   `sync.contentTemplates: false`.
9. **Page templates** - Page variants that render the full page around the
   content, unless excluded with `--no-page-templates` or
   `sync.pageTemplates: false`. A page template file can set `"default": true`
   to become the site default page variant (written through
   `/canvas/api/v0/settings/default-page-variant` with the `canvas:page_variant`
   scope); at most one file may claim it. The current site default is never
   deleted by a push.

### `reconcile-media`

Upload external media referenced in local page specs, content templates, and
page templates to Drupal and store provenance metadata so that those resources
can be pushed.

When page specs, content templates, or page templates contain image or document
props with external URLs (e.g. `https://example.com/photo.jpg` or
`https://example.com/report.pdf`), they cannot be pushed directly because Drupal
expects a media entity reference. This command downloads each external file,
uploads it to Drupal as a media entity of the matching type (`image` or
`document`), and updates the local spec with the resolved media data and
provenance (`target_id`).

**Usage:**

```bash
npx canvas reconcile-media [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--no-pages`: Exclude pages from media reconciliation
- `--no-content-templates`: Exclude content templates from media reconciliation
- `--no-page-templates`: Exclude page templates from media reconciliation
- `-y, --yes`: Skip confirmation prompts (non-interactive mode)

**Examples:**

Reconcile all external media in enabled local pages, content templates, and page
templates:

```bash
npx canvas reconcile-media
```

Non-interactive mode for CI/CD:

```bash
npx canvas reconcile-media --yes
```

### `agents-context`

> **Experimental:** This command is experimental and may change in future
> releases.

Pull context for AI agents working on content templates and write it to
`.agents/drupal-canvas/`. The directory contains:

- `prop-sources.json` — for each entity bundle and component, the available
  field bindings agents can use as prop sources.
- `view-modes.json` — view modes available per entity type and bundle.
- `content-entity-reference-expressions.json` — available entity field
  expressions for content-entity-reference props, grouped by entity type and
  bundle. Use the `cer-preview` context provider to resolve component CER props
  into full JavaScript prop value objects.
- `.gitignore` — ignores the generated files; the directory should not be
  committed.

**Usage:**

```bash
npx canvas agents-context <provider> [providerArg] [options]
npx canvas agents-context --all [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--site-url <url>`: Site URL
- `--client-id <id>`: Client ID
- `--client-secret <secret>`: Client Secret
- `--scope <scope>`: Scope
- `--all`: Execute all default context providers

**Example:**

List available providers:

```bash
npx canvas agents-context
```

Execute all default providers:

```bash
npx canvas agents-context --all
```

Execute only one provider:

```bash
npx canvas agents-context cer-preview article-card
```

Available providers:

- `content-templates` — writes `prop-sources.json` and `view-modes.json`.
- `content-entity-reference-expressions` (`cer-expressions`)
- `content-entity-reference-preview` (`cer-preview`) — requires a component
  ID/name argument. It uses the first preview entity suggestion for each CER
  prop and prints the resolved prop values returned by the preview endpoint.

---

### `login`

Log in to a Canvas site via browser using the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow
with PKCE. Stores the resulting access and refresh tokens in
`~/.config/drupal-canvas/oauth.json` (keyed by site URL). After logging in,
`canvas push` and `canvas pull` use the stored token automatically.

**Usage:**

```bash
npx canvas login [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--site-url <url>`: Canvas site URL (prompted if not provided)
- `--client-id <id>`: OAuth client ID for the consumer configured in Drupal
  admin
- `--port <number>`: Local callback port (default: `4444`). The consumer's
  redirect URI must match: `http://localhost:<port>/callback`.

**Example:**

```bash
npx canvas login --site-url https://example.com --client-id my-cli-client
```

The CLI opens your browser to the Drupal login page, waits for authorization,
then saves your tokens locally. Requires the consumer to be configured for the
Authorization Code grant with `http://localhost:4444/callback` (or the port you
specify) as a redirect URI — see the
[canvas_oauth setup guide](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/canvas/-/tree/1.x/modules/canvas_oauth#23-interactive-login-with-canvas-login).

---

### `logout`

Remove stored credentials for a Canvas site from
`~/.config/drupal-canvas/oauth.json`.

**Usage:**

```bash
npx canvas logout [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--site-url <url>`: Canvas site URL to log out of (prompted if not provided)

**Example:**

```bash
npx canvas logout --site-url https://example.com
```

---

### `validate`

Validate local components, pages, content templates, page templates, and
`canvas.brand-kit.json`.

**Usage:**

```bash
npx canvas validate [options]
```

**Options:**

- `-d, --dir <directory>`: Component directory to validate (defaults to
  `componentDir` from `canvas.config.json` or `src/components`)
- `--fix`: Apply available automatic fixes for linting issues

**Examples:**

Validate the project:

```bash
npx canvas validate
```

Validate components in a specific directory:

```bash
npx canvas validate --dir ./my-components
```

Validate and auto-fix issues:

```bash
npx canvas validate --fix
```

Validates discovered local components using ESLint with `required` configuration
from
[@drupal-canvas/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@drupal-canvas/eslint-config),
and validates authored pages, content templates, and page templates. With
`--fix` option specified, also applies automatic fixes available for some
validation rules.
