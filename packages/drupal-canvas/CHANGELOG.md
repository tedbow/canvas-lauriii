## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 73d9fb8: Reverted !1632

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- ed541e3: Add the shared runtime APIs for React Code Components that run in
  Drupal and in React-based headless frontends. New React hooks/providers and
  their provider prop types are exported from `drupal-canvas/react`; existing
  components and utility import paths remain unchanged. Framework-neutral
  data/client types remain at the root.
  - `usePageContext()` and `useSiteContext()` replace `getPageData()` and
    `getSiteData()`; `CanvasContextProvider` supplies the values, and the
    `PageContext`, `SiteContext`, and `CanvasContext` types describe them.
  - `useJsonApiClient()` and `JsonApiClientProvider` replace
    `new JsonApiClient()` in components; `createJsonApiClient()` (from
    `drupal-canvas/jsonapi-client`) is the shared, framework-agnostic client
    with draft reads at a resource version, same-origin proxy mapping,
    `DraftSessionError`, and scoped caches.
  - `getPageData()`, `getSiteData()`, and `new JsonApiClient()` are deprecated.
    They keep working in Drupal-rendered Code Components and Canvas Workbench
    previews and throw an actionable migration error elsewhere.
  - `Region` and `RegionsProvider` are deprecated in favor of page variants.

  The shared client treats a 401 answered to an authenticated direct request as
  a rejected session (`DraftSessionError`), caches authenticated responses only
  with an explicit session-unique `cacheScope`, keeps the applicable read
  options (locale, sparse fieldsets, includes, an explicit resource version) for
  working-copy item reads and merges their included resources, and accepts
  `apiUrl` for JSON:API served from a separate base URL while the Decoupled
  Router stays on `baseUrl`.

  Caching is disabled without an explicit scope for every client that carries a
  session (cookies, the proxy, previews, resource versions), 401s are classified
  by the credentials the request actually carried, selected working copies take
  precedence over included copies of the same resource, and URLs keep the
  backend's site path for JSON:API, the Decoupled Router and index lookups.

  Shared caching also stays off, absent an explicit scope, for the legacy
  client, custom transports and browser clients with default credentials; a 401
  is classified by the configured credential lifecycle (with
  `fetchAuthenticates` for custom transports) and credential acquisition
  failures never downgrade a draft read; `apiSiteUrl` localizes a JSON:API base
  on another site.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- f65ea20: Add `canvasFormatDate`, `canvasFormatDateTime`, `canvasFormatTime`,
  and `canvasFormatDateRange` utilities for displaying Canvas date props in the
  active Drupal locale.
  - Each function reads `drupalSettings.canvasData.v0.langcode` and formats an
    ISO date/time string using `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.
  - Dates are rendered in UTC to prevent timezone-offset shifts on the viewer's
    device. A date-time or time value without a UTC offset is treated as UTC.
  - An optional `options` argument (`CanvasDateFormatOptions`) overrides the
    default `'short'` style for the date and/or time portion.

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 3ed0539: Render an `Image` whose `src` has no `alternateWidths` query
  parameter unoptimized.
  - Drupal generates no derivative images for an image its image toolkit cannot
    process, such as an SVG image. Such an image is now rendered as-is, without
    `srcset` and `sizes`, instead of with candidates that every point at a
    broken derivative.
  - The default loader no longer logs an error per candidate width for such an
    image.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 108e9d4: Ship the document schema in `json-render-utils` so `document` prop
  refs resolve during CLI validation.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 761cfbb: Set minimum Node.js requirement: >=22.19.0 <23 || >=24.5.0.
