# 17. Full Workspaces integration: the workspace is the unit of publish

Date: 2026-08-04

Issue: <https://www.drupal.org/project/canvas/issues/3588540>

## Status

Proposed

Amends [ADR 14](0014-stage-autosaves-in-a-dedicated-workspace.md): the
publish half of that decision (per-item publish, workspace publish blocked)
is superseded; its staging mechanics are retained per workspace.

## Context

Phase 1 (ADR 14) adopted core Workspaces as a storage layer only: one hidden
workspace (`canvas_default`, labeled "Canvas") staged every editor's
auto-saves, Canvas published selected items one at a time by saving them to
Live outside the workspace, and core workspace publish was blocked in both
access control and the publish operation. That left Canvas unable to do what
Workspaces exists for: parallel streams of work that mix Canvas and
non-Canvas content, are reviewed as a unit, and go live atomically.

The branch this builds on also adopted the contrib `workspace_config` module
for configuration staging, but had not enabled it: the Phase 1 model wrote
Live config on `canvas.api.*` routes while reads happened inside the active
workspace, splitting the two across config cache partitions.

## Decision

Canvas editing becomes fully workspace-scoped, and the workspace becomes the
unit of review and publish.

1. **Staging follows the active workspace.** Auto-save reads and writes
   resolve against core's negotiated active workspace, falling back to the
   Main workspace (`canvas_default`, relabeled from "Canvas"; same machine
   ID, no data migration). Auto-save keys are workspace-prefixed
   (`{workspace}:{type}:{id}[:{langcode}]`), which partitions every staging
   store — snapshot rows (which gain a `workspace` field and a
   workspace-qualified unique key), buffer rows, key-value staging, form
   violations, pruner bookkeeping, and caches — per workspace. Buffer rows
   flush into the workspace recorded in their key even if the user has
   switched since. Route-scoped workspace activation is removed; the editor
   activates the Main workspace (persisting) when negotiation yields none.

2. **The workspace is the unit of publish.** The publish endpoint takes no
   item selection: it validates every item tracked in the active workspace
   (entity validation plus recorded form violations; update access per
   item), stages any snapshot-held drafts into the workspace, and calls core
   `Workspace::publish()` inside one database transaction (core's own
   transaction becomes a savepoint). Core promotes every tracked revision —
   sibling translations and dependent path aliases included, which removes
   Phase 1's grouping and dependent-publish workarounds — and the
   `workspace_config` pre-publish subscriber applies staged configuration.
   A post-publish subscriber clears Canvas's staging stores and completes
   the workspace: a published named workspace is deleted (its content is
   live; nothing is lost), and sessions pointing at it fall back to the
   Main workspace. The Main workspace is the one permanent workspace — it
   survives its publishes with the schedule consumed and the review state
   reset to draft.

3. **Configuration stages into the workspace.** `workspace_config` is now a
   hard dependency and enabled. The Phase 1 Live-write wrappers on
   `canvas.api.config.*` and content create/update/list routes are removed:
   while a workspace is active those writes stage into it, which also
   dissolves the config cache partition split (writes and reads share the
   workspace partition). Content deletion remains a Live operation — core
   has no staged deletion. Snapshot rows remain the store for drafts that
   cannot be persisted (code editor working copies, storage-rejected
   payloads), now per workspace.

4. **Review process defined as a core workflow.** The review steps are an
   ordinary workflow of a Canvas-provided workflow type
   (`canvas_workspace_review`): states carry an "approved for publishing"
   flag (the publish gate), one state is the initial state, and each
   transition is gated by its own generated permission
   (`use {workflow} transition {transition}`, mirroring content_moderation).
   Canvas ships a default workflow (draft → in review → approved with
   submit/approve/send-back transitions); sites can reshape it in the core
   Workflows UI or define their own and point a workspace at it via the
   `canvas_review_workflow` base field. Workspaces also gain
   `canvas_workspace_status` (a state ID of that workflow; unknown or empty
   values resolve to the initial state), `canvas_require_review` (default
   TRUE for named workspaces, FALSE for Main), and scheduling fields. The
   pre-publish subscriber rejects publishes of review-required workspaces
   whose state is not approved-for-publishing — covering the Canvas API,
   core Workspaces UI, and cron alike. Any staged write into a workspace
   beyond the initial state demotes it back and cancels its schedule;
   publish-time staging suppresses demotion since it is not an editorial
   write. Contrib (wse, workspace_approval, entity_workflow) was evaluated
   and rejected in the spec process; core Workflows was initially deferred,
   then adopted once the fixed three-state machine proved to be a strict
   subset of what a workflow type expresses.

5. **Scheduled publishing.** `canvas_scheduled_publish_at/by/error` fields
   on the workspace; scheduling requires publish access and (where review is
   required) the approved state. Cron publishes due workspaces through the
   same validated, gated pipeline, account-switched to the scheduling user.
   A failure cancels the schedule and records the error on the workspace
   instead of retrying.

6. **Cross-workspace locks are surfaced.** Core's one-workspace-per-entity
   semantics apply to named workspaces. The Phase 1 constraint exemption is
   narrowed: only Live saves (no active workspace) of an entity tracked
   solely in the Main workspace remain exempt. Canvas staged writes check
   ownership explicitly (programmatic saves bypass validation) and reject
   foreign-owned entities with a structured 409 naming the owning
   workspace; the editor receives lock and active-workspace context at boot
   so it can warn before the first write.

7. **Management API.** Thin endpoints wrap core: list viewable workspaces
   (with review state ID, its label, approved/initial flags, the
   permission-filtered available transitions, schedule, pending count,
   access flags), create, delete, activate (persisting via core
   negotiation, so external surfaces such as a site dashboard observe the
   same active workspace), review transitions (by workflow transition ID;
   the UI renders whatever transitions the server offers), and
   schedule/unschedule.

8. **Update path.** `canvas_update_11202` enables `workspace_config`,
   installs the new fields, backfills snapshot rows, and re-keys the
   key-value stores; `canvas_post_update_0032_main_workspace` (running
   after the Phase 1 key-value migration) relabels the workspace, moves it
   to the default provider, and maps the provider-granted access onto core
   permissions ("view any workspace" for Canvas-editor roles; "edit any
   workspace" and "create workspace" for publisher roles). The legacy
   `canvas` workspace provider class remains only for the update window.
   `canvas_update_11203` enables the Workflows module, creates the shipped
   review workflow, converts `canvas_workspace_status` to a plain string
   (workflow state IDs are open-ended), and installs
   `canvas_review_workflow`;
   `canvas_post_update_0033_review_workflow_permissions` maps the two
   legacy review permissions onto the shipped workflow's per-transition
   permissions and revokes them.

## Consequences

1. **BREAKING: per-item publish is retired.** Publishing publishes the
   whole active workspace; item-level scoping is achieved by which
   workspace you work in. One invalid item blocks the workspace publish
   with grouped per-item violations; discarding the item unblocks it.
2. Non-Canvas changes (node forms, config edits) made while a workspace is
   active publish with it — by design, and the review manifest lists them
   (content from workspace association with revision-metadata attribution;
   config from `workspace_config` rows presented as the config objects they
   stage).
3. Publish access follows core workspace access, where the publish
   operation maps to the `edit` permissions; granting "edit any workspace"
   to publisher roles is coarser than Phase 1's locked-down model. Sites
   should review the granted permissions.
4. Immediate-Live behaviors change inside workspaces: creating patterns,
   folders, or components while a named workspace is active stages them
   (they take effect for that workspace's preview and go live on publish).
5. The transactional-rollback guarantee for config application is strongest
   on Canvas-triggered paths (API, cron), which wrap `Workspace::publish()`
   in an outer transaction. A publish from the core Workspaces UI applies
   config at the pre-publish event outside any outer transaction; a content
   failure after that point rolls back content but not caches invalidated
   during config application. Accepted as equivalent to workspace_config's
   own operating model.
6. Component-instance form violations remain keyed by component instance
   UUID without a workspace prefix; the same instance staged in two
   workspaces shares them. Accepted as an edge case.
7. Kernel and functional tests that asserted Phase 1's publish blockers and
   per-item flow assert the new semantics instead.
8. Core promotes staged revisions verbatim, which retires two Phase 1
   publish-time mutations: never-published drafts no longer auto-publish at
   publish (the editor's publish toggle stages the status instead), and
   published revisions keep the stager's revision authorship rather than the
   publisher's. Per-item update-access failures surface as grouped
   violations (422), not a 403.
9. content_moderation's own workspace gate applies: an item staged in a
   draft moderation state blocks the whole workspace publish until a
   published moderation state is staged. Core publish-gate refusals
   (`WorkspacePublishException`) map to 409 on the Canvas publish endpoint.
10. Workspace switches became frequent (staging enters and leaves workspace
    context throughout), and every switch makes workspace_config clear
    entity field definitions, which makes layout_builder clear block plugin
    definitions, which reaches Canvas's component generation. Without a gate, that
    cascade re-entered itself through the config saves generation performs
    and hung requests. Component generation therefore carries a reentrancy
    guard, runs outside any active workspace (generated Component config
    mirrors code, not editorial intent, so it must never stage), and the
    block manager decorator only regenerates when the block plugin ID set
    actually changed within a request. A same-request definition-only change
    (e.g. a relabeled Views block) regenerates on the next request instead.
11. Adopting core Workflows makes the review process site-configurable:
    review states and transitions are config, access is per-transition, and
    the shipped three-step workflow is only a default. The Canvas UI renders
    transitions dynamically from the API, so a reshaped workflow needs no UI
    change. The cost is a hard dependency on the Workflows module, config
    schema for the workflow type, and an update path that converts the
    status field to a plain string and remaps the two legacy review
    permissions onto per-transition ones. A workspace whose stored state its
    workflow no longer defines resolves to the workflow's initial state
    (mirroring content_moderation), so editing or swapping workflows cannot
    strand a workspace.
