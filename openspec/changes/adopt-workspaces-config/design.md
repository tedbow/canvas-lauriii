# Design: adopt-workspaces-config

## Context

Decided in MR 1056 review conversation (Lauri Timmanee, Ted Bowman, Christian Lopez Espinola, 2026-07-16). Phase 1 stages all config auto-saves as opaque JSON payload rows on `canvas_auto-save_snapshot`, which is enough while workspaces are only ever active on Canvas API routes. Phase 2 (full workspace integration) exposes workspaces to users across the whole site, where staged config must behave as real configuration inside the active workspace: Ted's motivating example is a content template for a teaser edited in a workspace that must affect a view rendered outside Canvas. The Phase 2 branch already implements workspace-scoped config loading; this change pulls that storage decision forward into Phase 1 so the storage does not have to migrate twice and so Canvas does not ship a second, competing config-staging storage next to the contrib Workspaces Config module.

Workspaces Config provenance: split out of Workspaces Extra, maintainers amateescu and S. Lu, ecosystem direction steered by catch, used by Tag1 in production on large sites (their edge-case hardening is a large part of the value). Status caveat: dev module, no tagged release.

Delivery: implementation happens on branch `3588540-workspaces-config`, forked from `3588540-stage-canvas-auto-saves` and pushed to issue 3588540. That branch carries these specs in-repo under `openspec/changes/adopt-workspaces-config/` (full target-state specs, not deltas), the amended ADR 0014, and the updated architecture diagram.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Valid config auto-saves staged as workspace-scoped configuration in `canvas_default` via Workspaces Config.
- The fallback store becomes an invalid-data store holding only what no primary store can persist; the one-store-per-target invariant preserved.
- No observable editor behavior change: same auto-save read API, same per-item publish, same validation lifecycle, no hot-path latency regression.
- Storage that Phase 2 can adopt unchanged.

**Non-Goals:**

- Exposing workspaces or staged config outside Canvas routes (Phase 2).
- Staging config entity types Canvas does not manage (sites can enable Workspaces Config for those themselves).
- Scheduling, moderation, or any other Phase 2 concern.
- Getting `workspaces_config` a stable release (worth raising upstream, not a blocker here).

## Decisions

### D1: Workspaces Config is the staging store for valid config auto-saves

The config persist path attempts a workspace-scoped config write first. Success means the staged values live as real config attached to `canvas_default`; loading that config with the staging workspace active yields staged values, loading it outside yields live values. The auto-save read API resolves config from this store the same way it resolves content from workspace revisions today.

Rejected alternative: keep Canvas config in the Phase 1 payload store and let sites run Workspaces Config beside it for everything else, configured to ignore Canvas-owned config. Two storages for the same problem, permanent divergence risk, and a guaranteed migration in Phase 2.

### D2: The invalid-data store holds only what no primary store can persist

`canvas_auto-save_snapshot` (the entity backing the invalid-data store) keeps its schema and read integration but narrows to a separate storage capable of storing invalid data: payloads rejected at storage level (invalid intermediate states, for content and config alike) and entity types neither Workspaces nor Workspaces Config can stage. Canvas clients load it through the auto-save read API; non-Canvas consumers (Views, entity display outside Canvas, and similar) never load it. The invariant from Phase 1 carries over with one addition: a successful persist to either primary store (workspace revision or workspace-scoped config) deletes the invalid-data entry for that target. Read precedence stays buffer, then invalid-data store, then primary store.

This resolves Phase 1's open question "should the snapshot entity also serve as the Phase 2 per-workspace config staging store": no, Workspaces Config does.

### D3: Publish and validation keep their Phase 1 shape

Per-item Canvas publish, all-or-nothing per request, no workspace-level publish. The only change is the source: config items are built from workspace-scoped config (or the invalid-data store for invalid entries), validated as typed configuration before any live write, then applied to live configuration. Discard additionally clears the workspace-scoped config for discarded items.

### D4: The invalid-data-only dirty-state edge case becomes explicit spec

From review: when the first and only staged state of a target sits in the invalid-data store (it was never persistable) and later normalized evaluation equals the canonical state, the old auto-save system looped forever on discard ("not exactly the same, keep it"). The baseline requirement "Dirty state is derived, not stored" already implies the right behavior; the spec makes the invalid-data-only path an explicit scenario so it is tested rather than discovered in production again.

### D5: Staging writes stay off the hot path

Writing to entity storage is too slow for the hot path of preview-critical editing requests; the deferred write buffer exists for exactly this reason. Routing valid config auto-saves into workspace-scoped configuration must not put synchronous entity-store or config-store writes back on that hot path: PATCH latency must not regress, and the buffer (or an equally cheap write) covers these writes, flushing into workspace-scoped configuration at kernel terminate the same way content flushes into revisions today.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [`workspaces_config` is a dev module with no release] → Pin to a vetted commit in composer; review on the implementation branch is the evaluation gate. Tag1 production usage mitigates maturity concerns more than the release status suggests.
- [Behavioral differences between opaque payloads and real config staging (config CRUD events, cache invalidation fire on staged writes)] → Covered by porting the existing config auto-save tests and running the full suite on the implementation branch; any event Canvas must suppress gets an explicit test.
- [Workspace-scoped config writes are slower than key-value writes] → Covered by D5: buffered writes on preview-critical routes; verify PATCH latency before merge (tasks).
- [Invalid config states must never hit the config storage layer] → The persist path checks first whether the payload can be persisted and routes failures to the invalid-data store, mirroring the content revision fallback; write-time validation of data semantics remains prohibited.
- [Module direction is community-owned] → amateescu, S. Lu, and catch drive it; check with Glaman, whose Acquia Source work inspired the Phase 1 config handling, before diverging from module conventions.

## Migration Plan

- No shipped-site migration: Phase 1 (MR 1056) has not merged, so no site holds Phase 1 config payload rows.
- The legacy key-value migration (post-update plus lazy) gains a branch: valid config rows stage into workspace-scoped config; rows that cannot persist stage into the invalid-data store. Attribution and timestamps preserved as in Phase 1.
- Update path additionally enables `workspaces_config`.

## Open Questions

- How do Live config writes on `canvas.api.*` routes stay visible to reads taken while the auto-save workspace is active? The config endpoints publish to Live and must step outside the workspace to do it, but every read on those routes happens inside the workspace, and the two resolve through different config cache partitions. Found in implementation: with `workspace_config` enabled, a PATCH returns updated values while the following GET still reports the pre-PATCH ones (CanvasConfigEntityHttpApiTest: testPattern, testJavaScriptComponent, testFolder, testContentTemplate). Note the trap: without stepping outside the workspace these tests can pass while the config is only ever staged and never reaches Live. See `\Drupal\canvas\Controller\ApiConfigControllers::executeOutsideWorkspace()`.
- Does Workspaces Config support every config operation Canvas stages (create, update, delete, rename) for its fixed set of managed config (code components, page regions, templates)?
- Where does per-editor attribution live for workspace-scoped config writes (Workspaces Config may not record an editor per staged config object; Canvas may need a sidecar or to keep invalid-data-store metadata for attribution)?
- Should the exclusive-edit story for config match content (is a staged config object protected against live edits outside Canvas, and is that even desirable in Phase 1)?
