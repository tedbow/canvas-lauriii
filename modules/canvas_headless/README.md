# Drupal Canvas Headless

Introduces first-class headless frontend app support to [Drupal Canvas](https://www.drupal.org/project/canvas):
the editor embeds your decoupled frontend app, and editors preview their work rendered by the app itself.

The module is experimental (`lifecycle: experimental`): while the Canvas Headless milestone is in progress, its APIs,
hooks, and configuration may change without a deprecation path.

## Requirements

- [Simple OAuth module](https://www.drupal.org/project/simple_oauth) (>=6.1.0), with its RSA keypair configured (see
  `/admin/config/people/simple_oauth`). The same keypair signs preview assertions; no additional keys are needed.
- The `custom_elements` module.
- A frontend app built on the Drupal Canvas Headless SDK. The SDK ships as the workspace package
  `@drupal-canvas/headless` (framework-agnostic core) plus one adapter per framework —
  `@drupal-canvas/headless-next` (Next.js), `@drupal-canvas/headless-astro` (Astro),
  `@drupal-canvas/headless-nuxt` (Nuxt), `@drupal-canvas/headless-tanstack-start` (TanStack Start),
  and `@drupal-canvas/headless-angular` (Angular) — with
  `@drupal-canvas/headless-react` as the shared React binding.

## Setup

1. Install the module. It provisions the OAuth consumer and scope it needs; there is nothing to create manually.
2. Grant `administer canvas headless frontends` to the roles that may manage the site-wide frontend list.
3. Grant `access canvas headless preview` to the editorial roles that should preview through a frontend app. The
   permission lets its holders mint preview credentials for themselves.
4. Open **Headless frontends** in Canvas, and add the frontend app URL, such as `http://localhost:3000`.

Opening an entity in the Canvas editor then loads the first frontend in the list with an active draft session.

In cloned environments, regenerate the Simple OAuth keypair per environment; with shared keys, preview credentials
minted on one clone would redeem on another.

## Published route previews

The module embeds the first configured frontend on published canonical entity
pages rendered by a Canvas component tree or an enabled `full` content template.
Any selected page variant must also be headless-compatible.

Embedding requires a logged-in user with `access canvas headless preview` and
access to the Drupal route. Other visitors and unsupported routes keep Drupal's
normal rendering.

Previews render saved content, templates, and page variants with the current
user's permissions. Drupal's toolbar, administration navigation, and status
messages remain visible around the iframe.

Custom frontend Content Security Policies must allow the Drupal origin in
`frame-ancestors`.

### Navigation

Eligible links open outside the iframe: Drupal-resolved paths use their Drupal
URL, while unresolved paths and external links use their original URL.
`target="_blank"` opens a new tab.

### Entity previews and revisions

Entities with enabled Canvas content templates can embed the frontend on their
`entity.{entity_type}.preview`, `entity.{entity_type}.revision`, and
`entity.{entity_type}.latest_version` routes. This includes node form previews,
core revision routes, and Content Moderation's latest-version routes. Embedding
requires the authenticated access described above and an enabled Canvas template
for the selected view mode. Other requests keep Drupal's normal rendering.

Canvas currently enables content templates only for nodes. Other entity types
require a module that adds content template support.

Previews render the selected entity revision or unsaved form values with saved
Canvas templates and page variants. Canvas auto-saves do not replace them. Preview
responses and their rendered content cannot be cached.

The frontend must serve preview and revision paths through its Drupal content
route handler. The SDK catch-all route can handle these paths.

### Building the browser code

Build browser assets with `npm run packages:build` from the repository root.

## Browser support

- Chromium-based browsers: works over HTTPS, and without HTTPS on a plain-http `localhost` dev server.
- Firefox: works over HTTPS; fails over plain http, and under "block all third-party cookies" unless the user adds
  a per-site exception for the Drupal site.
- Safari: follows CHIPS availability (unavailable in 18.5–26.1).

## Declaring preview-safe permissions

A preview token carries the editor's own permissions, capped to those declared safe for a read-only preview. The
module's baseline covers core content viewing; if your module defines view permissions that draft previews need,
declare them:

```php
function my_module_canvas_headless_safe_permissions(): array {
  return ['view my_module widgets'];
}
```

An undeclared permission means a preview shows too little, never too much. See `canvas_headless.api.php` for the
hook documentation, including the site-policy `_alter` hook.

## Canvas content endpoint

`GET /canvas/content-api?requestUri={requestUri}` accepts a site-relative Drupal request URI. Query strings
are supported; fragments are rejected. File URLs in content responses are absolute so they resolve from the
headless frontend rather than from the Drupal origin implicitly.

### Read-only preview language

Canvas's language selector passes the selected language through the embedded
read-only draft session for pages, content templates, and page templates. The
SDK's `fetchPage()` forwards it only while the draft session is live. It does
not change the editable editor iframe or add a public frontend language option.

The content endpoint honors this `language` hint only for preview-scoped tokens.
When negotiation must change, it sends one private, non-cacheable HTTP 302 back
to the same-origin content endpoint with the language-specific `requestUri` and
preview context. `fetchPage()` follows this transport redirect with the same
credential; it is not a frontend navigation result. A fresh request uses the
site's language-switch URL/query negotiation before routing and rendering,
including translation access checks, per-language page auto-saves, and template
translation overrides merged onto draft trees. If negotiation still does not
match after that hop, the endpoint returns 404 rather than redirecting again. A configured language
without a translation retains Drupal's fallback; an unknown language returns 400
when minting an assertion and 404 from the content endpoint.

As with coupled previews, interface and content negotiation are expected to agree.
Cross-domain language negotiation is not supported for this internal preview hint.

## Canvas entity endpoint

`GET /canvas/content-api/entity?type={entityType}&id={id}` renders one
content entity directly. Pass `viewMode={viewMode}` to render a specific
content-template view mode, for example
`/canvas/content-api/entity?type=node&id=1&viewMode=teaser`.

### Entity response

```text
{
  "content": {...},
  "managedByCanvas": true,
  "entity": {
    "entityType": "node",
    "bundle": "article",
    "id": "1",
    "uuid": "773942c6-3660-4c50-9a8d-e25966a69bff",
    "langcode": "en"
  }
}
```

`content` is one structured root or `null`. `managedByCanvas` is `false` when
Canvas does not manage the requested entity and view mode.

### Content response

This example requests French, but renders English because the French translation is unavailable.

```text
{
  "content": {...},
  "head": {
    "title": "Example page",
    "meta": [
      {
        "name": "description",
        "content": "Example description"
      },
      {
        "property": "og:title",
        "content": "Example page"
      }
    ],
    "script": [
      {
        "type": "application/ld+json",
        "textContent": {
          "@context": "https://schema.org",
          "@type": "WebPage",
          "name": "Example page"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "route": {
    "name": "entity.canvas_page.canonical",
    "requestUri": "/fr/page/1",
    "params": {
      "canvas_page": "1"
    },
    "managedByCanvas": true,
    "negotiatedLanguage": "fr",
    "translations": [
      { "langcode": "en", "name": "English", "nativeName": "English", "url": "/contact", "translationAvailable": true, "current": false, "external": false },
      { "langcode": "fr", "name": "French", "nativeName": "Français", "url": "/fr/page/1", "translationAvailable": false, "current": true, "external": false },
      { "langcode": "es", "name": "Spanish", "nativeName": "Español", "url": "/es/contact", "translationAvailable": true, "current": false, "external": false }
    ],
    "entity": {
      "entityType": "canvas_page",
      "bundle": "canvas_page",
      "id": "1",
      "uuid": "773942c6-3660-4c50-9a8d-e25966a69bff",
      "langcode": "en"
    }
  }
}
```

`content` is one structured root or `null`. Multiple roots use a transparent `renderless-container` with the ordered
roots in its `default` slot. Routes Canvas does not manage and managed routes with empty trees both use `content: null`.
`route.managedByCanvas` distinguishes them and remains `true` for an empty managed tree.

`head` is compatible with the [Unhead](https://unhead.unjs.io/) package. It always contains `title` and may also
contain `meta`, `link`, and `script`. Canonical links are omitted because the frontend owns its public URLs.

`route.negotiatedLanguage` is the negotiated content-language ID. `route.translations` lists every enabled
language, matching Code Components' `getPageData().mainEntity.translations`: `langcode`, localized `name`,
`nativeName`, `url`, `translationAvailable`, and `current`. Missing and denied translations both report
`translationAvailable: false`, with the established Code Component fallback URL semantics, not a guarantee
of access. `current` follows `route.negotiatedLanguage`; `route.entity.langcode` identifies the rendered
language. Monolingual sites and routes without a canonical content entity return an empty list.

A non-external `url` is a site-relative Drupal request URI, with the installation base path removed and the
language prefix or query preserved. External URLs remain absolute and are **not valid `fetchPage` input**;
this does not add SDK support for domain negotiation. Frontends map entries to their own public URLs.
The headless-only `external` flag and URL processing support Drupal request URIs: configured negotiation
priority and explicit query-language selection are preserved, while editor-only preview settings are omitted.

### Redirect response

```json
{
  "redirect": {
    "external": false,
    "url": "/new-path",
    "statusCode": 301
  }
}
```

Redirect results use HTTP 200; `statusCode` is the status the frontend should use for the browser redirect.

### Error response

Errors use RFC 9457 Problem Details and the `application/problem+json` media type:

```json
{
  "type": "about:blank",
  "title": "Bad Request",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "The requestUri query parameter must be a site-relative URI without a fragment."
}
```

`detail` is included when an additional explanation is available.

## Known limitations

- Canonical routes render the default revision. Use revision or latest-version
  paths with `fetchPage()` to render a published entity's forward revision.
- Core JSON:API filtered collections exclude unpublished content regardless of permissions; the example app avoids
  filtered collection queries for draft content.
- Content gated by a view permission not declared preview-safe is invisible in previews until the owning module
  declares it.
- Editors need view access to the entity they preview, not only edit access; without it the preview fails to start.
- The first URL in the site-wide frontend list is used for previews; reorder the list to change the active app.
  Enabling the module replaces the Drupal-rendered preview for every entity editing context. An entity without a
  canonical URL, or one the active app does not serve, shows a preview-start failure.
